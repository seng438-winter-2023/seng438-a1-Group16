# Introduction 

The objective of this lab was to impart a understanding of the fundamental principles of software testing. Through the practical implementation of manual testing techniques, we were able to identify and document defects within the system under examination. This was achieved through the execution of three distinct testing methodologies, specifically Exploratory testing, Manual Scripted testing and Regression testing as outlined in the laboratory instruction manual.Initially, our team had a limited understanding of the various testing methodologies. We had a basic understanding that in Exploratory Testing, test cases are not predetermined and it focuses more on the cognitive aspect of testing rather than pre-planning and executing predefined test cases. We had a moderate understanding of Manual Scripted Testing, which involves identifying the system's requirements and developing test cases to verify if the system meets those requirements. Following the completion of this laboratory, we have acquired a comprehensive understanding of the differences between the three types of testing, as well as the practical application of these testing methodologies in real-world scenarios.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan


We started off by reading the document given to us on github. Then ,we started noting the functionality of the  ATM into different categories.

The testing was then divided into 5 categories:
 System login/ System startup and System shutdown
Deposit 
Withdraw
Balance Inquiry 
Transfer

Since we decided to limit ourself to half an hour, we allocated six mins for each categories. In these six minutes each pair randomly went through the categories and performing  tests and checking if the functionality matches the promises given in the description in github. 




# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing


The exploratory functional testing involves simultaneous learning and testing of the program. It emphasizes on discovery and depends on the tester's capability to find flaws that are difficult to find within the parameters of other tests. We categorized the different functionalities of the program and tested each of them to report any possible bugs. In a large program, it is difficult to localize the faults in the program when we use exploratory testing. 

Manual Functional Testing focuses on creating test cases to verify all the functionalities of the program. The tests are planned out before testing the functionality and the steps are laid out correctly. Manual functional testing is useful for dealing with large programs as it allows the tester to gain a clear idea of the test-cases. For the System under test (STU) for this assignment, we were able to verify all the tests that were missed in the initial phase.


-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Our group of 4 was divided into 2 groups to carry out the pair testing on the ATM simulation system. The method of pair testing we followed was each of the members of a pair took turns at being a tester and reviewer. We implemented the pair testing on the exploratory testing method explained in the lab documentation. 
Before carrying out our exploratory test plan mentioned above, both the pairs wrote down the main functionalities of the ATM simulation system after thoroughly reading the high level requirements. We made sure to understand what was expected of the system in each of the 5 categories that we divided to test the system in.
Each pair got 30 minutes to carry out the exploratory test plan on the 5 categories separately and reported all the bugs that we came across. After the 30 minutes were up, both the pairs came together to share with each other their findings and reported all the bugs in Azure.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned


1.Creating a test plan: It was very hard initially to come up with an appropriate plan to do the exploratory testing as it can be challenging to ensure that all test cases are comprehensive and cover all relevant scenarios. Hence, an appropriate test planning was done to ensure all areas of the software functionalities were covered.

2.Coordination: It was difficult to coordinate the efforts of all the team members,since pair testing was done and a group inside a group existed. 

3.Time Management: It was a challenge to balance the workload among team members and ensure that testing is completed within a reasonable timeframe.We set a targeted time to work on the assignment outside the lab hour to make sure the project was completed on time.

4.Eliminating Redundancy: Since multiple testers were testing the system, a lot of the errors found were redundant and explored by several team members which later had to be identified and eliminated. 

Lessons: 

1.Communication between group members is essential, as this could have avoided many redundancies. 

2.Have thorough knowledge of the distinctions between the three forms of testing, as well as the ability to use these testing approaches in practice in real-world situations.

3.Learned how to operate a new bug tracking tool called Azure Devops.
