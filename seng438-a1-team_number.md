# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The plan used was pretty simple where 2 group members worked on testing and reporting 
while 2 group members worked on writing on azure devops however, there were occasional
swaps where a group member testing became the group member writing the test and vise versa.

The testing was divided into 5 Sectors:
 System login/ System startup and System shutdown
Deposit 
Withdraw
Balance Inquiry 
Transfer 
The group members who were responsible for testing; started by dividing the 5 sectors and then 
manually entering each sector and performing  tests and checking if the functionality matches 
the promises given in the description in github.
