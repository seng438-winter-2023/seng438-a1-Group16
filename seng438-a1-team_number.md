The objective of this lab was to impart a understanding of the fundamental principles of software testing. Through the practical implementation of manual testing techniques, we were able to identify and document defects within the system under examination. This was achieved through the execution of three distinct testing methodologies, specifically Exploratory testing, Manual Scripted testing and Regression testing as outlined in the laboratory instruction manual.Initially, our team had a limited understanding of the various testing methodologies. We had a basic understanding that in Exploratory Testing, test cases are not predetermined and it focuses more on the cognitive aspect of testing rather than pre-planning and executing predefined test cases. We had a moderate understanding of Manual Scripted Testing, which involves identifying the system's requirements and developing test cases to verify if the system meets those requirements. Following the completion of this laboratory, we have acquired a comprehensive understanding of the differences between the three types of testing, as well as the practical application of these testing methodologies in real-world scenarios.

# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan


We started off by reading the document given to us on github. Then ,we started noting the functionality of the  ATM into different categories.

The testing was then divided into 5 categories:
 System login/ System startup and System shutdown
Deposit 
Withdraw
Balance Inquiry 
Transfer

Since we decided to limit ourself to half an hour, we allocated six mins for each categories. In these six minutes each pair randomly go through the categories and performing  tests and checking if the functionality matches the promises given in the description in github.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
